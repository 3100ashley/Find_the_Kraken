Welcome to Adventure Into The Ocean. You are equipped with a 3 powers to your magic wand to find and defeat the Kraken.
You will go through the caves blindly. Make sure to be aware of your surroundings. There's a possibility of drowning to
death, a snake stealing a power, a power up, and of course the Kraken it's self. The Kraken should be asleep. Try to shoot 
if you feel the Kraken is near by, but be careful. The sound of your magic wand will awaken the Kraken and he will move. 
If he moves to the cave you are in, game over. Good luck.
